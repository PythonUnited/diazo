# Test <attcopy>.  First, use <append> to copy over some stuff 
# intoy <body>.  Then, use the @class on a <div> in the content
# to set the body/@class.
/html/body/@class='foo'
not(//div[@id='wrapper'])
/html/body/*[1][name()='p']
/html/body/div[@id='content']/p/text() = 'boo bar baz'

#

# so it works when not matching on an overlapping <body> 
# selection.
